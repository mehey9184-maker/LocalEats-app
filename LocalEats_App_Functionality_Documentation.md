# LocalEats App Functionality Documentation

## Overview
LocalEats is a comprehensive food discovery and ordering application for local legendary Kota joints, featuring user authentication, profile setup, smart dispatch, and a seamless checkout experience with real-time live map tracking.

## Core Feature Implementation Details
- **Authentication & User Profiles**: Users can set up profiles, save delivery addresses, and manage preferences. Handled via Supabase Auth and `profiles` table.
- **Smart Dispatch Algorithm**: Dynamically assigns couriers (riders) to orders based on real-time geographical proximity to the store. Driven by a `calculateDistance` utility checking against live rider telemetry.
- **Order Tracking System**: UI represents strict tracking phases:
  - *Pending*: Default state.
  - *Cooking*: Order is being prepared.
  - *Ready*: Order is prepared and waiting for pickup.
  - *Rider Approach*: Order is being prepared AND a rider is assigned and en route to the shop.
  - *Live Delivery*: Order is picked up. Activates live telemetry map and direct driver chat banner.
  - *Completed*: Order delivered successfully.

## API Integrations
- **Supabase Backend**: Primary BaaS for auth and database operations.
  - Key Tables: `orders`, `rider_locations`, `profiles`, `shops`.
  - Real-time Subscriptions: Used extensively for live tracking `rider_locations` and instant `orders` status updates.
- **Leaflet / react-leaflet**: Core mapping engine handling all geospatial visualizations.

## Standardized Map Pin System Logic
- **Customer Location Pin**: Distinct Blue Pin with a pulsing live radar beacon (`userMapIcon`). Strictly enforced with `z-index: 2000` to guarantee it always renders visibly on top of all other elements.
- **Open Kitchens / Vendors**: Vibrant Orange Pin with storefront emblem and verified active badge (`createShopMapIcon(true)`).
- **Closed Kitchens**: Muted slate gray pin with offline status (`createShopMapIcon(false)`).
- **Live Couriers & Drivers**: Dedicated Indigo Pin with dynamic vehicle badges (bicycle, motorcycle, car, or scooter) and live proximity markers.
- **Coordinate Collision Safety**: Shops missing explicit GPS coordinates utilize a deterministic hashing and scattering algorithm (based on their shop ID) to distribute them gracefully and prevent marker stacking on a single default pixel.

## Update History
*(Assistant Maintenance Protocol: Summarize all successful code changes below this line)*

- **[2026-08-19] UX Fix: Live Form Error Resolution**:
  - Replaced passive toast/alert notifications with interactive, inline error resolution across all core forms (`CheckoutScreen`, `SignUpScreen`, `ProfileScreen`, `CompleteProfileScreen`).
  - Implemented dynamic boundary tracing (`border-red-500`) and live micro-copy injection (`text-[10px] text-red-500`) directly beneath offending inputs. 
  - Integrated smart auto-scrolling and auto-focus (`scrollIntoView` and `ref.focus()`) to pull the user's viewport directly to the invalid field, preventing confusion during checkout or registration.
  - **Typographic Integrity**: Completely stripped legacy custom font classes (`font-display`, `font-['Outfit']`, `Plus_Jakarta_Sans`) from the Order Tracking, map telemetry components, and root `App.tsx` container, enforcing strict `font-sans` variables. Eliminated all remaining `text-[8px]` and `text-[9px]` sizes globally across `MapLegend`, `MapComponents`, and `NetworkHeartbeatMonitor` and bumped them to legible `text-[10px]` with `whitespace-nowrap`.
  - **Depth Flattening**: Replaced heavy drop-shadows on interactive cards (`shadow-2xl`) with elegant border contrast shifts and `shadow-xl` across the Order Tracking telemetry dashboard and `App.tsx` root layout container to maintain design cohesiveness.
- **[2026-08-19] Pre-Phase 6 Fixes**: Implemented deterministic scattering algorithm for shop coordinates to prevent overlapping with user pins. Enforced z-index 2000 for user location pin.
- **[2026-08-19] Phase 5**: Established Trust Anchors, Map Icon Standardization & UX Psychology. Standardized all map pins across Explore, Discover, Address Selection, and Order Tracking views. Integrated live courier category into floating map legend with 1-tap filtering.
